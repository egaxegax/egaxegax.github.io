Crowded House (1986)  
  That's What I Call Love  
  
  You take away my air  
  You make my lungs collapse  
  I die tonight  
  Feeling devastated  
  That's what I call  
  Livin' in your memory  
  That's what I call  
  Tired and deflated  
  That's what I call  
  Love  
  
  I tidy up your room  
  You tidy up my life  
  Show me the door  
  
  I'm abandoned here  
  I'm warm to the core  
  I can feel  
  You sink I swim  
  We never got in that deep  
  You bend I break  
  I die tonight  
  
  Feeling devastated  
  That's what I call  
  Hangin' on and fallin' over  
  That's what I call  
  Tired and deflated  
  That's what I call  
  Love  
  
  I got a little room  
  The air's still pretty bad  
  I die tonight  
  
  Feeling devastated  
  That's what I call  
  Hangin' on and fallin' over  
  That's what I call  
  Tired and deflated  
  That's what I call  
  Feeling devastated  
  That's  
  Livin' with a vacuum cleaner  
  What  
  Sweepin' up your memory  
  I call Love
