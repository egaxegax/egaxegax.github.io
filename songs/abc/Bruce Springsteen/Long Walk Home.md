Intro: ***G     D***  
  
  ***G***  
Last night I stood at your doorstep  
Trying to figure out what went wrong  
  ***Em7***  
You just slipped somethin' into my palm   
  ***G     D***  
Then you were gone  
  ***G***  
I could smell the same deep green of summer  
Above me the same night sky was glowin'  
       ***Em7                         G  D***  
In the distance I could see the town where I was born  
   
  ***G***  
It's gonna be a long walk home  
Hey pretty Darling, don't wait up for me  
  ***Em7***  
Gonna be a long walk home  
  ***G               D***  
A long walk home  
   
  ***G***  
In town I passed Sal's grocery  
The barbershop on South Street  
  ***Em7***  
I looked into their faces  
  ***G          D***  
They were all rank strangers to me  
  ***G***  
The veterans' hall high up on the hill  
Stood silent and alone  
  ***Em7***  
The diner was shuttered and boarded  
  ***G       D***  
With a sign that just said "gone"  
  
  ***G***  
It's gonna be a long walk home  
Hey pretty Darling, don't wait up for me  
  ***Em7***  
Gonna be a long walk home  
Hey pretty Darling, don't wait up for me  
  ***Cadd9***  
Gonna be a long walk home  
  ***G                D***  
It's gonna be a long walk home

  ***D***  
Here everybody has a neighbor  
  ***Am***  
Everybody has a friend  
  ***D           Cadd9     D***  
Everybody has a reason to begin again  
  
  ***G***  
My father said "Son, we're lucky in this town  
It's a beautiful place to be born  
  ***Em7***  
It just wraps its arms around you  
  ***G               D***  
Nobody crowds you, nobody goes it alone.  
  ***G***  
That you know flag flying over the courthouse  
Means certain things are set in stone  
  ***Em7           G     D***  
Who we are, what we'll do and what we won't."  
  
  ***G***  
It's gonna be a long walk home  
Hey pretty Darling, don't wait up for me  
  ***Em7***  
Gonna be a long walk home  
Hey pretty Darling, don't wait up for me  
  ***Cadd9***  
Gonna be a long walk home  
  ***G                D***  
It's gonna be a long walk home  
  
  ***G***  
It's gonna be a long walk home  
Hey pretty Darling, don't wait up for me  
  ***Em7***  
Gonna be a long walk home  
Hey pretty Darling, don't wait up for me  
  ***Cadd9***  
Gonna be a long walk home  
  ***G                D***  
It's gonna be a long walk home  
  ***G***  
It's gonna be a long walk home
