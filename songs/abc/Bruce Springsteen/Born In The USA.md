  ***E***  
Born down in a dead man's town  
The first kick I took was when I hit the ground  
  ***A***  
End up like a dog that's been beat too much  
Till you spend half your life just covering up  
  
  ***E***  
Born in the USA, I was born in the USA  
  ***A                 E***  
I was born in the USA, born in the USA now  
  
  ***E***  
Got in a little hometown jam  
So they put a rifle in my hand  
  ***A***  
Sent me off to a foreign land  
To go and kill the yellow man  
  
  ***E***  
Born in the USA, I was born in the USA  
  ***A                 E***  
I was born in the USA, born in the USA now  
  
  ***E***  
Come back home to the refinery  
Hiring man said "*Son if it was up to me*"  
  ***A***  
Went down to see my V.–ê. man  
          ***E | E | E | E | A | A | A | A***  
He said "*Son, don't you understand*"  
  
  ***E***  
I had a brother at Khe Sahn  
Fighting off the Viet Cong  
  ***A***  
They're still there, he's all gone  
  ***E***  
He had a woman he loved in Saigon  
          ***A | A | A | A***  
I got a picture of him in her arms now  
  
  ***E***  
Down in the shadow of the penitentiary  
Out by the gas fires of the refinery  
  ***A***  
I'm ten years burning down the road  
Nowhere to run ain't got nowhere to go  
  
  ***E***  
Born in the USA, I was born in the USA  
  ***A                           E***  
Born in the USA, I'm a long gone Daddy in the USA now  
Born in the USA, Born in the USA  
  ***A***  
Born in the USA, I'm a cool rocking Daddy in the USA now
