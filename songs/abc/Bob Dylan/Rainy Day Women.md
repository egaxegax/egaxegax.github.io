Well, they'll stone you when you're at the breakfast table  
They'll stone you when you are young and able  
They'll stone you when you're riding in your car

Well, they'll stone you when you're walking on the street  
They'll stone you when you're tryin' to keep your seat  
They'll stone you when you're tryin' to make a buck  
Then they'll stone you and then they'll say "good luck"  
But I would not feel so all alone  
Everybody must get stoned
