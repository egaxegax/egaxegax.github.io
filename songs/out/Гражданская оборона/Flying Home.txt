		Who are you? Who am I?

		Is it real to touch the sky?
>		            Dm           Am
		Nothing?s real for the sky, -

		Said the birds of paradise.

		I?am afraid, can?t you see?!
		Tell me, where you carry me?
		You will soon realize! -
		Said the birds of paradise.

Припев:		<     F>
		Flying home, flying home
>		                                  C
		To the land that you once had known,
>		                              Dm
		To the peace that once was true
>		         E              Am
		For a little girl like you.

		Flying home, flying home
		From the world that is made of stone
		Till your heart is light and free
		Like it once was meant to be.

		How I can go ahead,
		When my eyes are becoming wet?
		Save your tears! Dry your eyes! -
		Said the birds of paradise.

		By the time is passing by
		Say, how long do we have to fly?
		Moon will set - sun will rise! -
		Said the birds of paradise.

!		Припев

		Watch the sun! And here?s the light!
		Now I know what I?ve heard was right!
		Morning sun can make you wise, -
		Said the birds of paradise.
