Hello sweet victory

So nice meeting you here

Mmm, Mmm
F                     Am
So strange when you think about it
F7          D                   Gm
I never did anything out of my way
          B     C
I just strayed...

 F Am        B           C
Out in the fields of my love
Out in the fields of my love
Out in the fields of my love

B Gm C

Well met and thank you
I'm glad you taught me so well
It was fun being around for a while
So sad you have to stay here
Or, can you spread out your wings and fly with me...

Out in the fields of my love
Out in the fields of my love
Out in the fields of my love
