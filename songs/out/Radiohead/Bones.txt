		I don't want to be crippled cracked
>		D         G       D/F#       A
		Shoulders, wrists, knees and back
>		D      G   D/F#    A
		Ground to dust and ash
>		D        G  D/F# A
		Crawling on all fours
>		           Em-D/F#-G               A
		When you've got to feel it in your bones
>		           Em-D/F#-G               A
		When you've got to feel it in your bones
		Now I can't climb the stairs
		Pieces missing everywhere
		Prozak painkillers
		When you've got to feel it in your bones
		When you've got to feel it in your bones

>		            G        D/F#  A
		And I used to fly like peter pan
>		               G            D/F#         A
		All the children flew when I touched their hands
		When you've got to feel it in your bones
		When you've got to feel it in your bones
