		Been thinkin 'bout you, your records up here
>		G             C/G  G                C/G   F#/D
		Your eyes on my wall, your teeth are over there
>		              Em                    F#/D  G
		But I'm still no-one, and you're a star

		What do you care
>		G             C/G  G                C/G   G
		Been thinkin 'bout you, and there's no rest
>		G             C/G  G                C/G   F#/D
		Should I still love you, still see you in bed
>		                     Em                 F#/D  G
		But I'm playin' with myself, what do you care
>		                        C/G    G
		When the other men are far far better
>		C 	  B/C        C            B/C       C
		All the things you got, all the things you need
>		C 	      B/C     C          B/C      B/Csus
		I bought you cigarettes, I'll bribe the company

		To come and see you, honey
>		G             C/G  G                C/G   G
		Been thinkin 'bout you, so how can you sleep
>		G               C/G      G                 C/G              F#/D
		These people aren't your friends, they're paid to kiss your feet
>		                           Em       F#/D      G
		But they don't know what I know, why should you care
>		     C/G      G
		When I'm not there
>		G             C/G  G                C/G   G
		Been thinkin 'bout you, and there's no rest
>		G             C/G  G                C/G   F#/D
		Should I still love you, still see you in bed
>		                     Em                 F#/D  G
		But I'm playin' with myself, what do you care
>		         C/G  G
		When I'm not there
>		C 	  B/C        C            B/C    C
		All the things you got, you'll never need
>		C 	      B/C     C          B/C      B/Csus
		All the things you got, I'm planning to bleed to,
