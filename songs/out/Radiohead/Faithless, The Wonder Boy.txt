		Faithless, The Wonder Boy

verse:		<D G A D Em G>

chorus:		<Bm A G F#m Em G>

LYRICS:		I've had these jeans since i was born
		And now they're ripped
		And now they're torn
		And all my friends have skateboards
		I want the toys of other boys
		I want a knife and a gun and thing
		But mum and dad will not give in
		And I can't put the needle in
		Can't put the needle in
		i can't put the needle in
		And now i know just what it is
		It's called disease and it's got my head
		It always runs where i hide
		Too scared to talk too scared to try
		Too scared to know the reasons why
		And all my friends say Bye Bye
		And I can't put the needle in
		Can't put the needle in
		I can't put the needle in
