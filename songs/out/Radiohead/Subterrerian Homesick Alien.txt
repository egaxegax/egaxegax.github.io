		The smell of the warm summer air
		I live in a town
		Where you can't smell a thing
		You watch your feet
		For cracks in the pavement
		Up above
		Aliens hover
		Making home movies
		For the folks back home
		Of all these weird creatures
		Who lock up their spirits
		Drill holes in themselves
		And live for their secrets

		They're all uptight
		Uptight.. } x7
		I wish that they'd swoop down in a country lane
		Late at night when I'm driving
		Take me on board their beautiful ship
		Show me the world as I'd love to see it
		I'd tell all my friends
		But they'd never believe
		They'd think that I'd finally lost it completely
		I'd show them the stars
		And the meaning of life
		They'd shut me away
		But I'd be all right
		All right..
		I'm just uptight
		Uptight.. } x7
