		The National Anthem

!		This funky bass riff is repeated all the way through the song. To make it
!		sound authentic you will need to use a Fuzz Box. I don't bother cause I'm
!		poor and can't afford one. I've worked this out using an acoustic guitar
!		instead of a fuzzy bass so I shall be expecting corrections! To be honest,
!		I've never picked up a bass guitar in my life...
!		The timings aren't correct but it isn't too hard to work out for yourself.
