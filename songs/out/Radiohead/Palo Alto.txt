!		Main Riff 1:    Main Riff 2:
		[------------------------------------------------
		------------------------------------------------
		-0h(1)//5-3-5-3---0h(1)//5-3-3h5p3(3)------------
		------------------------------------------------]
!		There's a bit in the verses that's hard to make
!		because of the guitar. I'm really not completley
!		sure, but i THINK it's:
!		Possible Riff 3:
		[--------------
		--------------
		-------3h5-5--
		-3--5---------]
!		Chorus:
		[-------------------------------------------------
		-------------------------------------------------
		---------------------------------5-5_B_5-5_B_b_B-
		-5-5-5---5-5-5--3-3_B_3-3_B_b_B------------------]
!		The last bit in the song (the almost solo part)
!		has a tricky and hard to make out base line, and
!		then goes into the riff 1 (with possibly the
!		Riff 2 variation). I'll try and figure out the
!		last part and send it out as soon as I can. Thanks...
