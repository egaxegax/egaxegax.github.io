>		Am
		Rows of houses, all bearing down on me
>		Am
		I can feel their blue hands touching me
>		Em
		All these things into position

		All these things we'll one day swallow whole
>		C        Em  Am         C   Em
		And fade out again and fade out
>		Am
		This machine will, will not communicate
>		Am
		These thoughts and the strain I am under
>		Em
		Be a world child, form a circle
>		Em
		Before we all go under
>		   C    Em  Am        C    Em  Am
		And fade out again and fade out again
		Cracked eggs, dead birds
		Scream as they fight for life
		I can feel death, can see its beady eyes
		All these things into position
		All these things we'll one day swallow whole
		And fade out again and fade out again
		Immerse your soul in love
		IMMERSE YOUR SOUL IN LOVE

!		There are four picking patterns used throughout the song. One for each of
!		the <Am>, <Em> and <C> chords used, with a change of pattern on the <Am> in the
!		second and subsequent verses (although the original pattern is still used
!		for the choruses and outro). Its hard to tell what the fingerpicked
!		guitar does when the chords change in the outro, as there is another
!		guitar over the top, playing some similar ideas up an octave (I might get
!		round to transcribing these one day!)

!		Here is the chord structure for the song:
!		Note that the complete picking pattern takes up two bars.

!		<Em> and <C> picking patterns as first verse <Am>, butthe appropriate chord
!		shapes formed (Standard <Em> and <C>) using the same descending notes on the
!		B string.
!		Watch out for cramps playing this one, as you have to hold
!		thatopen <Am> shape for a hell of a long time. Its best played on an
!		electroacoustic, with just a hint of reverb.

>		Am
		Rows of houses, all bearing down on me
		I can feel their blue hands touching me
>		Em
		All these things into position,
		All these things we'll one day swallow whole
!		<Am> (4 bars)
>		    C    Em  Am
		And fade out again
>		    C    E*m  Am
		And fade out again
>		    C   Em     Am
		Ohhhhhh Ohhhhh Ohhhhh
>		    C   Em
		Ohhhhhh Ohhhhh
!		*First chorus ends here.
!		Third chorus as above, but with a double length "Ohhhhh" section.
