		You And Whose Army

!		notes:
!		all these chords should be played as bar shapes, except <E> which is open.
!		most of the picking is straightforward enough if you give the song a listen.
!		the only dodgy shapes are:
!		<C#m/B> - [7x665x]
!		<C#m/Bb> - [6x6654]
!		the <C#> at the end is not quite major or minor; try [x466xx]
